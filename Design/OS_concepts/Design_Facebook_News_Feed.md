### Functionality 
* News Feed is the constantly updating list of stories in the middle of your home page. 
News Feed includes status updates, photos, videos, links, app activity and likes from people, 
Pages and groups that you follow on Facebook

#### Goal
* The goal of News Feed is to deliver the right content to the right people 
at the right time so they donâ€™t miss the stories that are important to them.

#### Challenge
* The ranking of the news
    * Every users may have around 1500 news feed, how to ranking them and highlight the most important ?
* highight the major updates to news feed 
* How will you save those pictures in the cache?
* How the machine will sync up each other ? 

#### How we decide the news feed algorithm 
The News Feed algorithm responds to signals from you, including, for example:
* How often you interact with the friend, Page, or public figure (like an actor or journalist) who posted
* The number of likes, shares and comments a post receives from the world at large and from your friends in particular
* How much you have interacted with this type of post in the past
* Whether or not you and other people across Facebook are hiding or reporting a given post

#### How could we test whether it works better or not ?
* In a recent test with a small number of users, this change resulted in a 5% increase in the number of likes, 
comments and shares on the organic stories people saw from friends and an 8% increase in likes, comments and 
shares on the organic stories they saw from Pages
* Previously, people read 57% of the stories in their News Feeds, on average. They did not scroll far enough to 
see the other 43%. When the unread stories were resurfaced, the fraction of stories read increased to 70%
