* Map
    * processes are sequentially and independently 
    * Could run multiple Map process parallelly 
    * called only once for the all input

* Reduce
    * Reduces process batches of values associated with the same key while Maps process keys independently
    * reduce called one time for the one key

* Different Product
    * Sort
    * Advantage:
      * A Map can know which contiguous sets of its key-value pairs (sharing the same key) need to be sent to one Reduce
      * A Reduce task can call the Reduce function on a contiguous set of key-value pairs (sharing the same key)
      * Sorting as an application becomes very simple to write

      * Ensure that no Reduce starts before all Maps are finished, that is, ensure the barrier between the Map phase and Reduce phase 
      * Someone writes a variant of Mapreduce without a barrier, i.e., where Reduces can start before all Maps are done computing. Which of the following are TRUE statements?
         * A Mapreduce run may be incorrect since some of the key-value pairs generated by Maps may never be processed by a Reduce if the reduce function is called exactly once per key
         * All Mapreduce runs could be correct if Reduces maintain partial results for keys, and update these as new key-value pairs come in
      * There is no communication between Maps and no communication between Reduces 
      *
