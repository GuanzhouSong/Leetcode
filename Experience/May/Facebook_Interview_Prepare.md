acebook技术面试准备书 作者：  廉世博Japser应一峰同学，旋同学，蔡老尸和文艺青年荣娟同学的要求，特将facebook准备书发一下。有兴趣的同学看一看，看看有没有去fb的实力。对于怎么让fb对你的简历感兴趣，请及时更新个人的linkedin和viadeo账户，fb的HR会定期在上面找他们感兴趣的人。

Preparing for a Facebook Interview
*        Google ‘Sillicone Valley Interviews’ – many helpful tips/advice will show up.
*        Solve as many Algorithm & Data Structure problems as you can between now and your interview 
*        Don’t spend time solving any challenges longer than 30-40 minutes at most, as the coding challenges on the day will be this length at most
*        Recommended interview preparation time before your Onsite – ideally 1-2 hours per day during the week and 4-5 hours during each weekend day [Given a 3-4 week preparation period]
*        Please apply for your travel Visa immediately (if required). Double check your Passport is valid.

Good books to read are: (we recommend you read one of the first 4 and get the 5th as a guide)
* “Programming interviews exposed”
* “Cracking coding Interviews”
* “Algorithm Design Manual”
* “Numerical Recipes” 
* “The art of computer programming” (Knuth) – Note: this is a very long book and not something you can read in a short space of time but it is very useful to have as an algorithm reference
    
Be familiar with life in Facebook:
* Read facebook.com/engineering carefully for latest news
* Check the latest numbers of users, status updates to get an idea of scale
* Google recent headlines about Facebook, read and take notes
    
    
    
Before interview:
* Have a good rest and do not overdress on the day (jeans and a shirt is perfect)    
* Take time to plan journey to office and be early, have all documents filled
* Keep your mind fresh and relax instead of last minute problem solving
During interview:
* Be enthusiastic and show why you would like to work here
* Ask necessary questions before you actually start coding so that you are clear
* Remember the interviewer will sometimes not give feedback or hints – it is because they want to allow you the opportunity to solve the problem and ‘shine’ during the interview. If you are genuinely stuck then don’t be afraid to ask for help (but not too much)
* Allow yourself to test code you have written before saying “I'm done” – always check over for bugs but don’t spend too long on checking e.g. check for edge cases/validity of input. 
* Few geeky jokes in appropriate positions are welcome    
*  Don’t code in pure silence but at the same time do not feel you have to talk constantly while you code – it is ok to say what you intend to do and then code in silence while you’re doing it. Try to get a balance.
Questions:
* Prepare 2 different questions for each interviewer e.g. 4 Coding questions (as you’ll have 2 coding interviews), 2 Design/Performance questions and 2 Cultural/Company questions
* Investigating Linked In profiles of interviewers helps to target questions
* No questions about salary at any stage, avoid discussion on this. It should not be a motivator for you. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Cultural Behavior Interview(this interview also has a shorter coding problem in it)
Areas you will need to prepare in advance:
• Information on your background as a developer
• Projects you’re most proud of and that you’ve worked on
• How you cope with problems and conflicts at work (e.g. with team mates)
• Your biggest weaknesses and strengths
• Why you want to work at Facebook (from a developer point of view)
• Ideas for new features (if you have any)
• Hardest problem you’ve solved
• Time you went above and beyond at work
• What you want to work on at Facebook
• What kind of position/role/team you are looking for
• Difficulties/restrictions  about your current work place (e.g. from a technical point of view)
• Why you want to work in a challenging environment
• Ideas on how to keep the quality of your work high while moving at a fast speed without a single QA
            
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Coding Interview
Key Areas to Practice In Advance
*        Data Structures
*        Algorithms
    
Note: You will be asked to code using a Whiteboard as opposed to your computer – therefore practice on paper a few times before the interview if you’re not comfortable or experienced with this. 
Sample Questions May Include (please note this is not a comprehensive list by any means, but will give you an idea of the style of questions that will come up):

1. Code LRU cache (Lease Recent Cached) class.
2. Check if string is palindrome. Avoid using memory buffer
3. Use pattern in dictionary. Pattern may have * which means any character
4. Design Facebook feed system
5. Reverse a linked list in place
6. Merge two sorted arrays
7. Semantics
8. A^B (A carrot B)
9. Scripting Language Test
10. Intersect n Sorted Arrays
11. Remove all elements equal to a value in an array compacting the array
12. Dot product of Spare Vectors 
13. Phone Permutations
14. Dutch Flag 
15. Insert +get_median
16. Find 3 numbers in an array summing to 0 
17. Max non-overlapping meetings (+ in K Rooms as well)
18. Binary Trees
19. Graph problems
20. Dijkstra’s algorithm (Daikstra’s algorithm)
Note: Dynamic Programming questions may also appear which are traditionally more difficult e.g. -"building bridges" (given pairs of cities lie on opposite sides of a river, what is the maximum number of "uncrossing" bridges that you can build).
    
    
Performance &Design Problems
Key Areas To Study (There is no coding in this interview, it’s purely discussion based) 
NB: Engage in discussion with the interviewer, don’t simply answer the questions. 
*        Concurrency
*        Networking
*        Databases
*        Systems Architecture
*        Scale – think about big data problems you might face and solutions for them
    
Note:
Sample Questions
1. Sharding Solutions (CPU vs. memory scaling on the leaves, document vs term sharding)
2. Distributed Systems
3. How would you design a Facebook chat or a private search feature
4. Compute/publish real-time aggregates on ad impressions
5. Identify event subscribers based on registered predicates
