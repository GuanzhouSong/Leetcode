1. Top next linked list
2. reverse the linked list
3. when there is duplicate ip in the network, how could we handle it ? (ARP)
4. AVL tree, hash table
5. Violate int in C, static int in C
6. L2 switch / Router, how does it work ?
7. NAT 
8. 
```
char *ptr;
*ptr = "hello";
*ptr = "t";
==> crashed !

char *ptr;
ptr = malloc(5);
*ptr = "hello";
*ptr = "t";
==> output *ptr: 'tello'

9. memory allocate, different C type saved in different memory allocate
