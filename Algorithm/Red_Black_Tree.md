#### Introduction
* Self-Balancing BST 
* Search, Insert, Delete take O(logn)
* Every Red-Black Tree with n nodes has height <= 2log(n+1)

#####Rules 
* Every node has a color either red or black.
* Root of tree is always black.
* There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
* Every path from root to a NULL node has same number of black nodes.
