#### Algorithm

* Open list:Nodes checking
* Closed list: Nodes already checked 
* g:  g(n) is the known cost of getting from the initial node to nï¼Œthis value is tracked by the algorithm
* h:  h(n) is a heuristic estimate of the cost to get from n to any goal node. 
* f = g + h
* each nodes has the parent 

```

    g_score[start] := 0    // Cost from start along best known path.
    // Estimated total cost from start to goal through y.
