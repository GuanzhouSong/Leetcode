#### AVL Tree Introduction
* Self-balancing Binary Search Tree
* Search, Insert, Delete take O(logn) time

##### Balance Factor
* Keep track of a balance factor for each node in the tree 
* ```balanceFactor = height(leftSubTree) - height(rightSubTree)```
* left-heavy: if the balance factor is greater than 0
* right-heavy: if the balance factor is less than 0
* If the balance factor is zero then the tree is perfectly in balance.
