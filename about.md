##关于面试

####1. 准备面试的tips
##### 1) Reach Out to Recruiters
a) Search with a query like recruiter *@adobe.com
* For example: [top 25 recuriter at FB](https://www.linkedin.com/title/recruiter-at-facebook)
b) Alumni Network 

##### 2) Prepare the resume 

####2. 跳槽目的:
1. I have learned a lot and enjoyed working with currect team recently, but I have joined the Cisco for almost three years and participate in design and develop the 2 generation productions in Nexus 7k, right now, we almost focus on the maintaince of the productions, so I want to try the differnt opportunity outside the Cisco. 
2. I want to build my experience in a new industry, I’m interested in working at [name of employer] based on the great things I have learned about it. 
3. Instead of the network area, I want to learn the distributed systems technology, how to build the large systems...facebook is the leader in this industry, so working here would mean that I would be at the top of my field. 
4. I really believe that the most important thing for any job is to make sure that you’re learning a lot. Whereas at many companies you really learn only about your own team, at Facebook/Google, employees seem to be encouraged to transfer teams, to share knowledge across teams, to do tech talks about their team’s architecture,

I feel confident that I can leverage my academic, professional, and “extracurricular” experience with
software development to make an impact on Google.

####3. 工作类型:
1. Have participated in design and develop two generations in Nexus 7k products, focus on the L2/L3 features on different generations for forwarding ASICs. 
2. Designed and developed a classic binary logs parsing application using Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery and Javascript. The application used internally in Cisco for debug purpose, more than 1k usages in first 3 months.
3. Designed and developed Virtual Network Segmentation in forwarding infrastructure for NXOS VINCI architecture solution on fabricpath technology

####4. 工作内容:

| Projects | Flanker(F3) | Vinci | Blogger | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Most Challenging | details of different traffic flow | Learn the high-level structure, scale issue |  Scale, speed up| 
| What You Learned | traffic flows | IaaS| build website |
| Influencing Someone | new product | next generation data center | QA in data center | 
| Improvement | speed up the component time | improve the scale, reduce the driver calls etc. | 1) more random input 2) add the timestamp, component filter | 
| Mistake |  | | | 

##### Vinci 
1. Current data center architectures are unable to meet growing customer needs in terms of scale, service, flexibility, managebility 
2. Cisco’s solution and strategy is “Vinci” – a next gen data center architecture for scalable multi-tenant data centers – initially targeting Service Provider and Enterprise Data Center segments.  
3. Multi Tenancy is a critical technology in cloud computing. One instance of application can serve multiple customers by sharing the resources. Important technology for N7K to move towards virtualization. Implemented on Vinci architecture with Spine-Leaf topology 
4. Vinci provides a next-generation data center architecture that is built on a spine-leaf topology that provides optimal connectivity at Layer-2 and Layer-3 between hosts at the leaf switches in the fabric and between the hosts and the external network. The fabric essentially provides an overlay network that allows the spine nodes to act as transit nodes that only switch on the fabric overlay header.
